<img src="cdar-high-resolution-logo-transparent.png" width="50%">
CDAR is a comprehensive GitHub repository dedicated to providing an end-to-end solution for addressing security threats and techniques outlined in the Mitre ATT&CK Framework. This repository is designed to help organizations configure their systems, cloud, networks, and applications to generate the necessary logs, establish robust detection and alerting mechanisms, and implement response strategies for efficient incident handling.

## Introduction

Cybersecurity is of paramount importance in today's digital landscape, and organizations need to be proactive in securing their assets. The CDAR repository aims to provide a holistic approach to cybersecurity by guiding users through the processes of configuration, detection, alerting, and response to potential security threats.

## CDAR Overview

### Configuration
The Configuration section of CDAR focuses on providing guidance on configuring various aspects of your infrastructure to generate the necessary logs for effective security monitoring. It covers:

- Configuring Operating Systems to produce relevant security event logs.
- Configuring Cloud services securely to log activities and events.
- Network configurations to ensure logs capture relevant network traffic.
- Application configurations to minimize vulnerabilities and generate security logs.

### Detection
The Detection section assists in log collection and normalization. It provides instructions on how to:

- Set up log collection mechanisms to gather logs from various sources.
- Normalize logs for consistent and coherent analysis.
- Utilize detection rules to identify potential security threats and anomalies.

### Alerting
Alerting in CDAR provides predefined queries used in Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems. These queries are designed to generate alerts for specific security events. We employ the SIGMA detection format (https://github.com/SigmaHQ/sigma) for creating vendor-agnostic SIEM queries, ensuring compatibility with a variety of SIEM solutions.

### Response
The Response section offers examples of incident response playbooks that can be implemented in Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) systems. These playbooks guide you through effective response actions to mitigate, contain, and remediate security incidents.

## Repository Structure
